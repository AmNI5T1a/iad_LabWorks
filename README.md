# iad_LabWorks

First Laboratory work:
        
        First task : 1.Creating 2 spaces(massives,lists and so on)
                    2.Paste values inside your lists or random it(Doesn't matter for him)
                    3.Using this formule: Sqrt((p1-q1)^2+(p2-q2)^2)- calculate answer
                    
               
               How to use my work for example:
               1.Input first point
               2.Input second point
               3.Input space length(can't be less than this 2 point)
               
               
       Second task : 1.Work in progress..
                    
               
       Third task : 1.Creating Vector2 space
                    2.Paste random values inside this space from -1000 to 1000(u can change it: csharp(CS0103) [32,102])
                    3.Using EuculidDistance mehtod findning closest point
                    
               
               How to use my work for example:
               1.Input number of neighbors u want to search
               2.Input number of points u want to create in your space
               3.Choose r point from space (from 0 to pointsInSpace)
