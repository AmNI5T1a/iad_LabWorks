## :black_square_button:First Laboratory work:
- [X] First task: 
    > **Description:**
    >
    > Here we need to create a `space`.
    >
    > For example : two-dimensional array, List(Vector2) or struct with two double or float points.
    >
    > _How to use my work as an example:_
    > -  Choose first task in main menu.
    > -  Input from keyboard number of points in your `space`.
    
    
- [X] Second task:
    > **Description:**
    >
    > Here you need to create a feature space, calculate the points inside it, merge neighboring points into one class/set 
    >
    > The next task is to calculate the intraset distance.
    >
    > Explanation: we multiply each point of set A to all other points of set A (the same set).
    >
    > Next, we are calculating distance between the sets, this is the same, but we multiply each point of the set A by each point of the set B.
    >
    > Use all formulas from here: [Интеллектуальный анализ данных - 1.pptx](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A4qAGeKilR3Sfo9bIo6zLJrC8F-faaCA)
    >
    > _How to use my work as an example:_
    > -  Choose second task in main menu.
    > -  Inject number of classes.
- [X] Third task: 
    > **Description:** 
    >
    > You need to create space, fill it with x and y axis, calculate the Eulidean distance between all points and choose those that are closest 
    >
    > _How to use my work as an example:_
    > -  Choose third task in main menu.
    > -  Input number of neighbors you want to find. 
    > -  Input from keyboard number of points in your `space`.
    > -  Choose any point from the proposed.
